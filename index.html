	<div class="columns_2"><p>Legend has it that a servant in an early expedition exploring Brazil’s
interior pocketed a few grains of an odd black metal he found while 
drinking from a river near the current site of Ouro Preto. It turned out
to be gold, and the local deposits were soon discovered to be the 
largest in the New World. 

Gold fever spread fast. In 1711, Vila Rica de Ouro Preto was founded, 
and in 1721 it became the capital of Minas Gerais. Gold bought the
services of baroque artisans, who turned the city into an architectural 
gem. At the height of the gold boom in the mid-18th century, there 
were 110,000 people (mainly slaves) in Ouro Preto, compared with 
50,000 in New York and about 20,000 in Rio de Janeiro. In theory, all gold was brought to casas de intendéncias 
(weighing stations), and a quinto do ouro (royal fifth) was set aside for
the Portuguese crown. The greed of the Portuguese led to sedition, </p>
</div>

<div class="columns_2"><p> as 
the miners found it increasingly difficult to pay ever-larger gold taxes. In 1789, poets Claudio da Costa, Tomás Antônio Gonzaga, 
Joaquim José da Silva Xavier (nicknamed Tiradentes, meaning 
‘Tooth Puller,’ for his dentistry skills) and others, full of French 
Revolutionary philosophies, hatched an uprising against Portuguese 
colonization known as the Inconfidência Mineira. 

The rebellion was crushed in its early stages by agents of the crown. 
Gonzaga was exiled to Mozambique and Costa did time in prison. 
Tiradentes was jailed for three years, then drawn and quartered in 
Rio de Janeiro. His head was paraded around Ouro Preto, his house 
demolished and its grounds salted to ensure that nothing would 
grow there.

In 1897 the state capital was shifted from Ouro Preto to 
Belo Horizonte, decisively preserving the city’s colonial flavor. In 1980,
 Ouro Preto was enshrined as Brazil’s first Unesco World Heritage Site.</p>

				<img src="images/culture.jpg" alt="culture"><b><p class="section-copy">Name Calling</p></b>
				<p>Brazilians make no distinction between private and public environments. We don’t call people by their last names, for example. Unless the person is introduced to us by his/her last name, we will call him/her by the first name or even by a nickname. This difficulty Brazilians have to separate private from public is a direct result of organic or communal relations. In other words, it means that Brazilians relate to each other based on kinship, neighborhood and friendship. In the mind of most Brazilians, it isn’t wrong to use the influence as a boss to employ a cousin instead of giving opportunity for those who had already been in the company or went through a selection process.</p>

	<div class="columns_2">
		<img src="images/churrascaria.jpg" alt="churrascaria"><b><p class="section-copy">Food</p></b>
		<p>Brazilian society as a whole is very food-oriented. It is not out of nothing that almost half of the Brazilian population is considered to be overweight. If European people would invite their friends for a soccer match, Brazilians would invite their friends for a barbecue. Every celebration in Brazil is full of food as this is seen as a sign of prosperity. This is so strongly intricate in the Brazilian popular culture as a whole that it is extended to the business environment: on a Friday after work, most Brazilians would rather meet their colleagues at a bar, a pizzeria or a “churrascaria” than inviting them to go golfing or playing soccer. </p>

				<p>The street carnaval in Ouro Preto attracts thousands of people every year. Traditional band music is played across town, and many people dress up in costumes during the holiday. There are two main types of street parade in town: the one with samba schools and the one with blocos. Carnaval usually takes place in February or March, depending on the timing of Lent. It starts on the Saturday immediately before Lent and ends the day before Ash Wednesday. </p>

			<p>Semana Santa in Ouro Preto is considered one of the most traditional of Brazil and dates back to the eight century. The celebrations are ceremonies that attest to the particularity of religious culture in Ouro Preto. Events include: concerts involving a repertoire of sacred music composed in the rich colonial town during the Gold Cycle; staged liturgical shows always on the stairs of churches; Sacred Way with tableaus; production of films and pamphlets with the history and description of the ceremonies and rituals; local art exhibitions in various halls and galleries of the city, making handmade rugs and decorative arts.</p>

		<p>Ouro Preto is a city found in Minas Gerais, Brazil. It is located -20.39 latitude and -43.51 longitude and it is situated at elevation 1201 meters above sea level. Ouro Preto has a population of 63,678 making it the 46th biggest city in Minas Gerais. It operates on the BRST time zone, which means that it follows the same time zone as Belo Horizonte. Ouro Preto is about 100 kilometers from Belo Horizonte, 400 km from Rio de Janeiro, and 680 kilometers from São Paulo. Ouro Preto can be reached by bus from Belo Horizonte international airport (CNF - Tancredo Neves International Airport, Confins), which has frequent connections to São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Relatively inexpensive flights from the Rio de Janeiro (RJ) Galeao airport (GIG) to the Belo Horizonte (BH) Confins airport (CNF) can be booked and purchased on-line on two Brazilian airline companies, namely TAM (IATA code JJ) and GOL (IATA code G3), with round-trip ticket prices even below US$50. Brazil has reciprocity agreements with many countries and, as a result, visitors from some foreign countries need a Visa. It is recommended to contact the nearest Brazilian Embassy or Consulate in your city, at least 45 days prior to your travel, to obtain all necessary information. </p>
